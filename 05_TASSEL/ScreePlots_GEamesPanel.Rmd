I did PC analysis using the filtered markers dataset that I use for mapping. 
I am examining all the PCs to evaluate how many i need to include
#1 Load data
```{r}
pcs <- read.table("./PCA_ames_filt-Taxa-Markers-MAF1_20241121.txt", skip = 2, header = T, sep =  "\t")
head(pcs)

eigens <- read.table("./Eigenvalues_ames_filt-Taxa-Markers-MAF1_20241121.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
head(eigens)
```

#2 Scree Plot
```{r}
eigens %>% filter(cumulative.proportion <= 0.9)

eigens %>% filter(PC <= 25) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = PC, y = proportion.of.total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```




```{r}
ggplot(pcs, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point()
```
